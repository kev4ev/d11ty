# Do a `d11ty`, Make Your PDFs Pretty!

Wouldn't it be great if there was a way to beautify your PDFs without hand-writing css elements and classes? You can with the super-powered `d11ty` shortcode (technically a paired shortcode in eleventy, thank you very much). 

The following Bulma element classes can wrap any content: 
- [box](https://bulma.io/documentation/elements/box/)
- [notification](https://bulma.io/documentation/elements/notification/)

Check out the exemplars in this directory!
