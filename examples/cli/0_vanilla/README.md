# Single-Files Examples

The files in this directory were all converted from markdown to PDF individually, from the command line, as such:

```sh
# run from project root
d11ty examples/markdown1.md
```

They use only plain markdown syntax with no added [Bulma](https://bulma.io/documentation/) classes...though I would highly recommend you check them out to truly beautify your own docs.
