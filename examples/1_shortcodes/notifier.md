# Let's do some notifyin'

{% d11ty 'notification', 'is-success' %}
Didn't know what time it was, the lights were low
I leaned back on my radio
Some cat was laying down some rock 'n' roll
"Lotta soul," he said
Then the loud sound did seem to fade
Came back like a slow voice on a wave of phase
That weren't no DJ, that was hazy cosmic jive
