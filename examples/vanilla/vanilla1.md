# Don't Stop Believin'

<!-- we'll use some page breaks to split up the verses and chorus -->

> Just a small town girl \
> Livin' in a lonely world \
> She took the midnight train going anywhere \
> Just a city boy \
> Born and raised in South Detroit \
> He took the midnight train going anywhere

> A singer in a smokey room \
> A smell of wine and cheap perfume \
> For a smile they can share the night \
> It goes on and on and on and on

> Strangers waitin' \
> Up and down the boulevard \
> Their shadows searchin' in the night \
> Streetlights, people \
> Livin' just to find emotion \
> Hidin', somewhere in the night
